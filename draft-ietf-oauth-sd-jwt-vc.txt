1.  Introduction

1.1.  Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model

   In the so-called Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model, Issuers issue so-
   called Verifiable Credentials to a Holder, who can then present the
   Verifiable Credentials to Verifiers.  Verifiable Credentials are
   cryptographically secured statements about a Subject, typically the
   Holder.

            +------------+
            |            |
            |   Issuer   |

             +-------------+|  Verifiable Credential  +------------+
              +-------------+

    Figure 1: Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model with optional Status Provider

   Verifiers can check the authenticity of the data in the Verifiable
   Credentials and optionally enforce Key Binding, i.e., ask the Holder
   to prove that they are the intended holder of the Verifiable
   Credential, for example, by proving possession of a cryptographic key
   referenced in the credential.  This process is further described in
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

   To support revocation of Verifiable Credentials, revocation
   information can optionally be retrieved from a Status Provider.  The
   role of a Status Provider can be fulfilled by either a fourth party
   or by the Issuer.

1.2.  SD-JWT as a Credential Format

   JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) [RFC7519] can in principle be used to express
   Verifiable Credentials in a way that is easy to understand and
   process as it builds upon established web primitives.

   Selective Disclosure JWT (SD-JWT)
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] is a specification that
   introduces conventions to support selective disclosure for JWTs: For
   an SD-JWT document, a Holder can decide which claims to release
   (within bounds defined by the Issuer).

   SD-JWT is a superset of JWT as it can also be used when there are no
   selectively disclosable claims and also supports JWS JSON
   serialization, which is useful for long term archiving and multi
   signatures.  However, SD-JWT itself does not define the claims that
   must be used within the payload or their semantics.

   This specification uses SD-JWT and the well-established JWT content
   rules and extensibility model as basis for representing Verifiable
   Credentials with JSON payloads.  These Verifiable Credentials are
   called SD-JWT VCs.  The use of selective disclosure in SD-JWT VCs is
   OPTIONAL.

   SD-JWTs VC can contain claims that are registered in "JSON Web Token
   Claims" registry as defined in [RFC7519], as well as public and
   private claims.

   Note: This specification does not utilize the W3C's Verifiable
   Credentials Data Model v1.0, v1.1, or v2.0.

1.3.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

1.4.  Terms and Definitions

   This specification uses the terms "Holder", "Issuer", "Verifier",
   "Disclosure", "Selectively Disclosable JWT (SD-JWT)", "Key Binding",
   "Key Binding JWT (KB-JWT)", "Selectively Disclosable JWT with Key
   Binding (SD-JWT+KB)" defined by
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

   Consumer:  Applications using the Type Metadata specified in
      Section 6 are called Consumer.  This typically includes Issuers,
      Verifiers, and Wallets.
   Verifiable Credential (VC):  An assertion with claims about a Subject
      that is cryptographically secured by an Issuer (usually by a
      digital signature).
   SD-JWT-based Verifiable Credential (SD-JWT VC):  A Verifiable
      Credential encoded using the format defined in
      [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].  It may or may not
      contain selectively disclosable claims.
   Unsecured Payload of an SD-JWT VC:  A JSON object containing all
      selectively disclosable and non-selectively disclosable claims of
      the SD-JWT VC.  The Unsecured Payload acts as the input JSON
      object to issue an SD-JWT VC complying to this specification.
   Status Provider:  An entity that provides status information (e.g.
      revocation) about a Verifiable Credential.

2.  Scope

   *  This specification defines
      -  Data model and media types for Verifiable Credentials based on
         SD-JWTs.
      -  Validation and processing rules for Verifiers and Holders.

3.  Verifiable Credentials based on SD-JWT

   This section defines encoding, validation and processing rules for
   SD-JWT VCs.

3.1.  Media Type

   SD-JWT VCs compliant with this specification MUST use the media type
   application/dc+sd-jwt as defined in Section 3.1.

   The base subtype name dc is meant to stand for "digital credential",
   which is a term that is emerging as a conceptual synonym for
   "verifiable credential".

3.2.  Data Format

   SD-JWT VCs MUST be encoded using the SD-JWT format defined in
   Section 4 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].  A
   presentation of an SD-JWT VC MAY contain a KB-JWT.

   Note that in some cases, an SD-JWT VC MAY have no selectively
   disclosable claims, and therefore the encoded SD-JWT will not contain
   any Disclosures.

3.2.1.  JOSE Header

   This section defines JWT header parameters for the SD-JWT component
   of the SD-JWT VC.

   The typ header parameter of the SD-JWT MUST be present.  The typ
   value MUST use dc+sd-jwt.  This indicates that the payload of the SD-
   JWT contains plain JSON and follows the rules as defined in this
   specification.  It further indicates that the SD-JWT is a SD-JWT
   component of a SD-JWT VC.

   The following is a non-normative example of a decoded SD-JWT header:

   {
     "alg": "ES256",
     "typ": "dc+sd-jwt"
   }

   Note that this draft used vc+sd-jwt as the value of the typ header
   from its inception in July 2023 until November 2024 when it was
   changed to dc+sd-jwt to avoid conflict with the vc media type name
   registered by the W3C's Verifiable Credentials Data Model draft.  In
   order to facilitate a minimally disruptive transition, it is
   RECOMMENDED that Verifiers and Holders accept both vc+sd-jwt and
   dc+sd-jwt as the value of the typ header for a reasonable
   transitional period.

3.2.2.  JWT Claims Set

   This section defines the claims that can be included in the payload
   of SD-JWT VCs.

3.2.2.1.  Verifiable Credential Type - vct Claim

   This specification defines the new JWT claim vct (for verifiable
   credential type).  The vct value MUST be a case-sensitive StringOrURI
   (see [RFC7519]) value serving as an identifier for the type of the
   SD-JWT VC.  The vct value MUST be a Collision-Resistant Name as
   defined in Section 2 of [RFC7515].

   A type is associated with rules defining which claims may or must
   appear in the Unsecured Payload of the SD-JWT VC and whether they
   may, must, or must not be selectively disclosable.  This
   specification does not define any vct values; instead it is expected
   that ecosystems using SD-JWT VCs define such values including the
   semantics of the respective claims and associated rules (e.g.,
   policies for issuing and validating credentials beyond what is
   defined in this specification).

   The following is a non-normative example of how vct is used to
   express a type:

   {
     "vct": "https://credentials.example.com/identity_credential"
   }

   For example, a value of https://credentials.example.com/
   identity_credential can be associated with rules that define that at
   least the registered JWT claims given_name, family_name, birthdate,
   and address must appear in the Unsecured Payload.  Additionally, the
   registered JWT claims email and phone_number, and the private claims
   is_over_18, is_over_21, and is_over_65 may be used.  The type might
   also indicate that any of the aforementioned claims can be
   selectively disclosable.

3.2.2.2.  Registered JWT Claims

   SD-JWT VCs MAY use any claim registered in the "JSON Web Token
   Claims" registry as defined in [RFC7519].

   The following registered JWT claims are used within the SD-JWT
   component of the SD-JWT VC and MUST NOT be included in the
   Disclosures, i.e., cannot be selectively disclosed:

   *  iss
      -  OPTIONAL.  As defined in Section 4.1.1 of [RFC7519] this claim
         explicitly indicates the Issuer of the Verifiable Credential
         when it is not conveyed by other means (e.g., the subject of
         the end-entity certificate of an x5c header).
   *  nbf
      -  OPTIONAL.  The time before which the Verifiable Credential MUST
         NOT be accepted before validating.  See [RFC7519] for more
         information.
   *  exp
      -  OPTIONAL.  The expiry time of the Verifiable Credential after
         which the Verifiable Credential is no longer valid.  See
         [RFC7519] for more information.
   *  cnf
      -  OPTIONAL unless cryptographic Key Binding is to be supported,
         in which case it is REQUIRED.  Contains the confirmation method
         identifying the proof of possession key as defined in
         [RFC7800].  It is RECOMMENDED that this contains a JWK as
         defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC7800].  For proof of
         cryptographic Key Binding, the KB-JWT in the presentation of
         the SD-JWT MUST be secured by the key identified in this claim.
   *  vct
      -  REQUIRED.  The type of the Verifiable Credential, e.g.,
         https://credentials.example.com/identity_credential, as defined
         in Section 3.2.2.1.
   *  status
      -  OPTIONAL.  The information on how to read the status of the
         Verifiable Credential.  See [I-D.ietf-oauth-status-list] for
         more information.

   The following registered JWT claims are used within the SD-JWT
   component of the SD-JWT VC and MAY be included in Disclosures, i.e.,
   can be selectively disclosed:

   *  sub
      -  OPTIONAL.  The identifier of the Subject of the Verifiable
         Credential.  The Issuer MAY use it to provide the Subject
         identifier known by the Issuer.  There is no requirement for a
         binding to exist between sub and cnf claims.
   *  iat
      -  OPTIONAL.  The time of issuance of the Verifiable Credential.
         See [RFC7519] for more information.

3.2.2.3.  Public and Private JWT claims

   Additionally, any public and private claims as defined in Sections
   4.2 and 4.3 of [RFC7519] MAY be used.

3.2.2.4.  SD-JWT VC without Selectively Disclosable Claims

   An SD-JWT VC MAY have no selectively disclosable claims.  In that
   case, the SD-JWT VC MUST NOT contain the _sd claim in the JWT body.
   It also MUST NOT have any Disclosures.

3.3.  Example

   The following is a non-normative example of the user data of an
   unsecured payload of an SD-JWT VC.

   {
     "vct": "https://credentials.example.com/identity_credential",
     "given_name": "John",
     "family_name": "Doe",
     "email": "johndoe@example.com",
     "phone_number": "+1-202-555-0101",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "123 Main St",
       "locality": "Anytown",
       "region": "Anystate",
       "country": "US"
     },
     "birthdate": "1940-01-01",
     "is_over_18": true,
     "is_over_21": true,
     "is_over_65": true
   }

   The following is a non-normative example of how the unsecured payload
   of the SD-JWT VC above can be used in an SD-JWT where the resulting
   SD-JWT VC contains only claims about the Subject that are selectively
   disclosable:

   {
     "_sd": [
       "09vKrJMOlyTWM0sjpu_pdOBVBQ2M1y3KhpH515nXkpY",
       "2rsjGbaC0ky8mT0pJrPioWTq0_daw1sX76poUlgCwbI",
       "EkO8dhW0dHEJbvUHlE_VCeuC9uRELOieLZhh7XbUTtA",
       "IlDzIKeiZdDwpqpK6ZfbyphFvz5FgnWa-sN6wqQXCiw",
       "JzYjH4svliH0R3PyEMfeZu6Jt69u5qehZo7F7EPYlSE",
       "PorFbpKuVu6xymJagvkFsFXAbRoc2JGlAUA2BA4o7cI",
       "TGf4oLbgwd5JQaHyKVQZU9UdGE0w5rtDsrZzfUaomLo",
       "jdrTE8YcbY4EifugihiAe_BPekxJQZICeiUQwY9QqxI",
       "jsu9yVulwQQlhFlM_3JlzMaSFzglhQG0DpfayQwLUK4"
     ],
     "iss": "https://example.com/issuer",
     "iat": 1683000000,
     "exp": 1883000000,
     "vct": "https://credentials.example.com/identity_credential",
     "_sd_alg": "sha-256",
     "cnf": {
       "jwk": {
         "kty": "EC",
         "crv": "P-256",
         "x": "TCAER19Zvu3OHF4j4W4vfSVoHIP1ILilDls7vCeGemc",
         "y": "ZxjiWWbZMQGHVWKVQ4hbSIirsVfuecCE6t4jT9F2HZQ"
       }
     }
   }

   Note that a cnf claim has been added to the SD-JWT payload to express
   the confirmation method of the Key Binding.

   above:

   Examples of what presentations of SD-JWT VCs might look like are
   provided in Section 4.2.

3.4.  Verification and Processing

   The recipient (Holder or Verifier) of an SD-JWT VC MUST process and
   verify an SD-JWT VC as described in Section 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].  The check in point 2.3 of
   Section 7.1 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt], which
   validates the Issuer and ensures that the signing key belongs to the
   Issuer, MUST be satisfied by determining and validating the public
   verification key used to verify the Issuer-signed JWT, employing an
   Issuer Signature Mechanism (defined in Section 3.5) that is permitted
   for the Issuer according to policy.

   If Key Binding is required (refer to the security considerations in
   Section 9.5 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt]), the
   Verifier MUST verify the KB-JWT according to Section 7.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].  To verify the KB-JWT, the
   cnf claim of the SD-JWT MUST be used.

   If a schema is provided in the Type Metadata, a recipient MUST
   validate the schema as defined in Section 6.5.

   If there are no selectively disclosable claims, there is no need to
   process the _sd claim nor any Disclosures.

   If status is present in the verified payload of the SD-JWT, the
   status SHOULD be checked.  It depends on the Verifier policy to
   reject or accept a presentation of a SD-JWT VC based on the status of
   the Verifiable Credential.

   Any claims used that are not understood MUST be ignored.

   Additional validation rules MAY apply, but their use is out of the
   scope of this specification.

3.5.  Issuer Signature Mechanisms

   An Issuer Signature Mechanism defines how a Verifier determines the
   appropriate key and associated procedure for verifying the signature
   of an Issuer-signed JWT.  This allows for flexibility in supporting
   different trust anchoring systems and key resolution methods without
   changing the core processing model.

   A recipient MUST determine and validate the public verification key
   for the Issuer-signed JWT using a supported Issuer Signature
   Mechanism that is permitted for the given Issuer according to policy.
   This specification defines the following two Issuer Signature
   Mechanisms:

   *  JWT VC Issuer Metadata: A mechanism to retrieve the Issuer's
      public key using web-based resolution.  When the value of the iss
      claim of the Issuer-signed JWT is an HTTPS URI, the recipient
      obtains the public key using the keys from JWT VC Issuer Metadata
      as defined in Section 5.

   *  X.509 Certificates: A mechanism to retrieve the Issuer's public
      key using the X.509 certificate chain in the SD-JWT header.  When
      the header of the Issuer-signed JWT contains the x5c header
      parameter, the recipient uses the public key from the end-entity
      certificate of the certificates from the x5c header parameter and
      validates the X.509 certificate chain accordingly.  In this case,
      the Issuer of the Verifiable Credential is the subject of the end-
      entity certificate.

   To enable different trust anchoring systems or key resolution
   methods, separate specifications or ecosystem regulations may define
   additional Issuer Signature Mechanisms; however, the specifics of
   such mechanisms are out of scope for this specification.  See
   Section 10.2 for related security considerations.

   If a recipient cannot validate that the public verification key
   corresponds the Issuer of the Issuer-signed JWT using a permitted
   Issuer Signature Mechanism, the SD-JWT VC MUST be rejected.

4.  Presenting Verifiable Credentials

   This section defines encoding, validation and processing rules for
   presentations of SD-JWT VCs.

4.1.  Key Binding JWT

   If the presentation of the SD-JWT VC is encoded as an SD-JWT+KB, the
   KB-JWT MUST adhere to the rules defined in Section 4.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

   The KB-JWT MAY include additional claims which, when not understood,
   MUST be ignored by the Verifier.

4.2.  Examples

   The following is a non-normative example of a presentation of the SD-
   JWT shown in Section 3.3 including a KB-JWT.  In this presentation,
   the Holder provides only the Disclosures for the address and
   is_over_65 claims.  Other claims are not disclosed to the Verifier.

   After validation, the Verifier will have the following processed SD-
   JWT payload available for further handling:

   {
     "iss": "https://example.com/issuer",
     "iat": 1683000000,
     "exp": 1883000000,

     }
   }

5.  JWT VC Issuer Metadata

   This specification defines the JWT VC Issuer Metadata to retrieve the
   JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration of the Issuer of the SD-JWT VC.
   The Issuer is identified by the iss claim in the JWT.  Use of the JWT
   VC Issuer Metadata is OPTIONAL.

   Issuers publishing JWT VC Issuer Metadata MUST make a JWT VC Issuer
   Metadata configuration available at the location formed by inserting
   the well-known string /.well-known/jwt-vc-issuer between the host
   component and the path component (if any) of the iss claim value in
   the JWT.  The iss MUST be a case-sensitive URL using the HTTPS scheme
   that contains scheme, host and, optionally, port number and path
   components, but no query or fragment components.

5.1.  JWT VC Issuer Metadata Request

   A JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration MUST be queried using an HTTP
   GET request at the path defined in Section 5.

   The following is a non-normative example of an HTTP request for the
   JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration when iss is set to
   https://example.com:

   GET /.well-known/jwt-vc-issuer HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

   If the iss value contains a path component, any terminating / MUST be
   removed before inserting /.well-known/ and the well-known URI suffix
   between the host component and the path component.

   The following is a non-normative example of a HTTP request for the
   JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration when iss is set to
   https://example.com/tenant/1234:

   GET /.well-known/jwt-vc-issuer/tenant/1234 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

5.2.  JWT VC Issuer Metadata Response

   A successful response MUST use the 200 OK HTTP and return the JWT VC
   Issuer Metadata configuration using the application/json content
   type.

   An error response uses the applicable HTTP status code value.

   This specification defines the following JWT VC Issuer Metadata
   configuration parameters:

   *  issuer
      -  REQUIRED.  The Issuer identifier, which MUST be identical to
         the iss value in the JWT.
   *  jwks_uri
      -  OPTIONAL.  URL string referencing the Issuer's JSON Web Key
         (JWK) Set [RFC7517] document which contains the Issuer's public
         keys.  The value of this field MUST point to a valid JWK Set
         document.
   *  jwks
      -  OPTIONAL.  Issuer's JSON Web Key Set [RFC7517] document value,
         which contains the Issuer's public keys.  The value of this
         field MUST be a JSON object containing a valid JWK Set.

   JWT VC Issuer Metadata MUST include either jwks_uri or jwks in their
   JWT VC Issuer Metadata, but not both.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the JWT contains a kid JWT header parameter
   that can be used to look up the public key in the JWK Set included by
   value or referenced in the JWT VC Issuer Metadata.

   The following is a non-normative example of a JWT VC Issuer Metadata
   configuration including jwks:

   {
      "issuer":"https://example.com",
      "jwks":{
         "keys":[
            {
               "kid":"doc-signer-05-25-2022",
               "kty": "EC", "crv": "P-256",
               "x": "b28d4MwZMjw8-00CG4xfnn9SLMVMM19SlqZpVb_uNtQ",
               "y": "Xv5zWwuoaTgdS6hV43yI6gBwTnjukmFQQnJ_kCxzqk8"
            },
            {
               "kid":"doc-signer-06-05-2025",
               "kty": "EC", "crv": "P-256",
               "x":"DfjUx4WHBds61vGbqUQhsy3FGX13fAS13QWh2EHIkX8",
               "y":"NfqJt9Kp0EA93xq9ysO80DRZ_hCGlISz-pYLgv4RFvg"
            }
         ]
      }
   }

   The following is a non-normative example of a JWT VC Issuer Metadata
   configuration including jwks_uri:

   {
      "issuer":"https://example.com",
      "jwks_uri":"https://jwt-vc-issuer.example.com/my_public_keys.jwks"
   }

   Additional JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration parameters MAY also
   be used.

5.3.  JWT VC Issuer Metadata Validation

   The issuer value returned MUST be identical to the iss value of the
   JWT.  If these values are not identical, the data contained in the
   response MUST NOT be used.

6.  SD-JWT VC Type Metadata

   An SD-JWT VC type, i.e., the vct value, is associated with Type
   Metadata defining, for example, information about the type or a
   schema defining (see Section 6.5.1) which claims MAY or MUST appear
   in the SD-JWT VC, and how credentials are displayed.

   This section defines Type Metadata that can be associated with a type
   of an SD-JWT VC, as well as a method for retrieving the Type Metadata
   and processing rules.  This Type Metadata is intended to be used,
   among other things, for the following purposes:

   *  Developers of Issuers and Verifiers can use the Type Metadata to
      understand the semantics of the type and the associated rules.
      While in some cases, Issuers are the parties that define types,
      this is not always the case.  For example, a type can be defined
      by a standardization body or a community.
   *  Verifiers can use the Type Metadata to determine whether a
      credential is valid according to the rules of the type.  For
      example, a Verifier can check whether a credential contains all
      required claims and whether the claims are selectively
      disclosable.
   *  Wallets can use the metadata to display the credential in a way
      that is consistent with the intent of the provider of the Type
      Metadata.

   Type Metadata can be retrieved as described in Section 6.3.

6.1.  Type Metadata Example

   All examples in this section are non-normative.

   The following is an example of an SD-JWT VC payload, containing a vct
   claim with the value https://betelgeuse.example.com/
   education_credential:

   {
     "vct": "https://betelgeuse.example.com/education_credential",
     "vct#integrity": "sha256-WRL5ca_xGgX3c1VLmXfh-9cLlJNXN-TsMk-PmKjZ5t0",
     ...
   }

   Type Metadata for the type https://betelgeuse.example.com/
   education_credential can be retrieved using various mechanisms as
   described in Section 6.3.  For this example, the vct value is a URL
   as defined in Section 6.3.1 and the following Type Metadata Document
   is retrieved from it:

   {
     "vct":"https://betelgeuse.example.com/education_credential",
     "name":"Betelgeuse Education Credential - Preliminary Version",
     "description":"This is our development version of the education credential. Don't panic.",
     "extends":"https://galaxy.example.com/galactic-education-credential-0.9",
     "extends#integrity":"sha256-9cLlJNXN-TsMk-PmKjZ5t0WRL5ca_xGgX3c1VLmXfh-WRL5",
     "schema_uri":"https://exampleuniversity.com/public/credential-schema-0.9",
     "schema_uri#integrity":"sha256-o984vn819a48ui1llkwPmKjZ5t0WRL5ca_xGgX3c1VLmXfh"
   }

   This example is shortened for presentation, a full Type Metadata
   example can be found in Appendix B.2.

   Note: The hash of the Type Metadata document shown in the second
   example must be equal to the one in the vct#integrity claim in the
   SD-JWT VC payload, WRL5ca_xGgX3c1VLmXfh-9cLlJNXN-TsMk-PmKjZ5t0.

6.2.  Type Metadata Format

   The Type Metadata document MUST be a JSON object.  The following
   properties are defined:

   *  name
      -  OPTIONAL.  A human-readable name for the type, intended for
         developers reading the JSON document.
   *  description
      -  OPTIONAL.  A human-readable description for the type, intended
         for developers reading the JSON document.
   *  extends
      -  OPTIONAL.  A URI of another type that this type extends, as
         described in Section 6.4.
   *  display: An array of objects containing display information for
      the type, as described in Section 8.  This property is OPTIONAL.
   *  claims: An array of objects containing claim information for the
      type, as described in Section 9.  This property is OPTIONAL.
   *  schema
      -  OPTIONAL.  An embedded JSON Schema document describing the
         structure of the Verifiable Credential as described in
         Section 6.5.1. schema MUST NOT be used if schema_uri is
         present.
   *  schema_uri
      -  OPTIONAL.  A URL pointing to a JSON Schema document describing
         the structure of the Verifiable Credential as described in
         Section 6.5.1. schema_uri MUST NOT be used if schema is
         present.

   An example of a Type Metadata document is shown in Appendix B.2.

6.3.  Retrieving Type Metadata

6.3.1.  From a URL in the vct Claim

   A URI in the vct claim can be used to express a type.  If the type is
   a URL using the HTTPS scheme, Type Metadata MAY be retrieved from it.

   The Type Metadata is retrieved using the HTTP GET method.  The
   response MUST be a JSON object as defined in Section 6.2.

   If the claim vct#integrity is present in the SD-JWT VC, its value
   vct#integrity MUST be an "integrity metadata" string as defined in
   Section Section 7.

6.3.2.  From a Registry

   A Consumer MAY use a registry to retrieve Type Metadata for a SD-JWT
   VC type, e.g., if the type is not an HTTPS URL or if the Consumer
   does not have access to the URL.  The registry MUST be a trusted
   registry, i.e., the Consumer MUST trust the registry to provide
   correct Type Metadata for the type.

   The registry MUST provide the Type Metadata in the same format as
   described in Section 6.2.

6.3.3.  Using a Defined Retrieval Method

   Ecosystems MAY define additional methods for retrieving Type
   Metadata.  For example, a standardization body or a community MAY
   define a service which has to be used to retrieve Type Metadata based
   on a URN in the vct claim.

6.3.4.  From a Local Cache

   A Consumer MAY cache Type Metadata for a SD-JWT VC type.  If a hash
   for integrity protection is present in the Type Metadata as defined
   in Section 7, the Consumer MAY assume that the Type Metadata is
   static and can be cached indefinitely.  Otherwise, the Consumer MUST
   use the Cache-Control header of the HTTP response to determine how
   long the metadata can be cached.

6.3.5.  From Type Metadata Glue Documents

   Credentials MAY encode Type Metadata directly, providing it as "glue
   information" to the Consumer.

   For JSON-serialized JWS-based credentials, such Type Metadata
   documents MAY be included in the unprotected header of the JWS.  In
   this case, the key vctm MUST be used in the unprotected header and
   its value MUST be an array of base64url-encoded Type Metadata
   documents as defined in this specification.  Multiple documents MAY
   be included for providing a whole chain of types to the Consumer (see
   Section 6.4).

   A Consumer of a credential MAY use the documents in the vctm array
   instead of retrieving the respective Type Metadata elsewhere as
   follows:

   *  When resolving a vct in a credential, the Consumer MUST ensure
      that the vct claim in the credential matches the one in the Type
      Metadata document, and it MUST verify the integrity of the Type
      Metadata document as defined in Section 7.  The Consumer MUST NOT
      use the Type Metadata if no hash for integrity protection was
      provided in vct#integrity.
   *  When resolving an extends property in a Type Metadata document,
      the Consumer MUST ensure that the value of the extends property in
      the Type Metadata document matches that of the vct in the Type
      Metadata document, and it MUST verify the integrity of the Type
      Metadata document as defined in Section 7.  The Consumer MUST NOT
      use the Type Metadata if no hash for integrity protection was
      provided.

6.4.  Extending Type Metadata

   An SD-JWT VC type can extend another type.  The extended type is
   identified by the URI in the extends property.  Consumers MUST
   retrieve and process Type Metadata for the extended type before
   processing the Type Metadata for the extending type.

   The extended type MAY itself extend another type.  This can be used
   to create a chain or hierarchy of types.  The security considerations
   described in Section 10.3 apply in order to avoid problems with
   circular dependencies.

6.5.  Schema Type Metadata

6.5.1.  Schema Definition

   Schemas for Verifiable Credentials are contained in the schema or
   retrieved via the schema_uri Type Metadata parameters (as defined in
   Section 6.2).  A schema MUST be represented by a JSON Schema document
   according to draft version 2020-12 [JSON.SCHEMA.2020-12] or above.

   The schema of a Verifiable Credential MUST include all properties
   that are required by this specification and MUST NOT override their
   cardinality, JSON data type, or semantic intent.

   The following is a non-normative example of a JSON Schema document
   for the example in Section 3.3 requiring the presence of the cnf
   claim in an SD-JWT VC presentation:

   {
     "$schema":"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
     "type":"object",
     "properties":{
       "vct":{
         "type":"string"
       },
       "iss":{
         "type":"string"
       },
       "nbf":{
         "type":"number"
       },
       "exp":{
         "type":"number"
       },
       "cnf":{
         "type":"object"
       },
       "status":{
         "type":"object"
       },
       "given_name":{
         "type":"string"
       },
       "family_name":{
         "type":"string"
       },
       "email":{
         "type":"string"
       },
       "phone_number":{
         "type":"string"
       },
       "address":{
         "type":"object",
         "properties":{
           "street_address":{
             "type":"string"
           },
           "locality":{
             "type":"string"
           },
           "region":{
             "type":"string"
           },
           "country":{
             "type":"string"
           }
         }
       },
       "birthdate":{
         "type":"string"
       },
       "is_over_18":{
         "type":"boolean"
       },
       "is_over_21":{
         "type":"boolean"
       },
       "is_over_65":{
         "type":"boolean"
       }
     },
     "required":[
       "iss",
       "vct",
       "cnf"
     ]
   }

   Note that iss and vct are always required by this specification.

6.5.2.  Schema Validation

   If a schema or schema_uri property is present, a Consumer MUST
   validate the Processed SD-JWT Payload JSON document resulting from
   the SD-JWT verification algorithm (as defined in Section 7.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt]) against the JSON Schema
   document provided by the schema or schema_uri property.

   If an extends property is present, the schema of the extended type
   MUST also be validated in the same manner.  This process includes
   validating all subsequent extended types recursively until a type is
   encountered that does not contain an extends property in its Type
   Metadata.  Each schema in this chain MUST be evaluated for a specific
   Verifiable Credential.

   If the schema validation fails for any of the types in the chain, the
   Consumer MUST reject the Verifiable Credential.

   The following is a non-normative example of a result JSON document
   after executing the SD-JWT verification algorithm that is validated
   against the JSON Schema document in the example provided in
   Section 6.5.1:

   {
     "vct":"https://credentials.example.com/identity_credential",
     "iss":"https://example.com/issuer",
     "iat":1683000000,
     "exp":1883000000,
     "sub":"6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "address":{
       "country":"DE"
     },
     "cnf":{
       "jwk":{
         "kty":"EC",
         "crv":"P-256",
         "x":"TCAER19Zvu3OHF4j4W4vfSVoHIP1ILilDls7vCeGemc",
         "y":"ZxjiWWbZMQGHVWKVQ4hbSIirsVfuecCE6t4jT9F2HZQ"
       }
     }
   }

   Note, the example above does not contain any _sd_alg, _sd, or ...
   claims.

7.  Document Integrity

   Both the vct claim in the SD-JWT VC and the various URIs in the Type
   Metadata MAY be accompanied by a respective claim suffixed with
   #integrity, in particular:

   *  vct as defined in Section 3.2.2.2,
   *  extends as defined in Section 6.4
   *  uri as used in two places in Section 8.1
   *  schema_uri as defined in Section 6.5

   The value MUST be an "integrity metadata" string as defined in
   Section 3 of [W3C.SRI].  A Consumer of the respective documents MUST
   verify the integrity of the retrieved document as defined in
   Section 3.3.5 of [W3C.SRI].

8.  Display Metadata

   The display property is an array containing display information for
   the type.  The array MUST contain an object for each language that is
   supported by the type.  The consuming application MUST use the
   language tag it considers most appropriate for the user.

   The objects in the array have the following properties:

   *  lang: A language tag as defined in Section 2 of [RFC5646].  This
      property is REQUIRED.
   *  name: A human-readable name for the type, intended for end users.
      This property is REQUIRED.
   *  description: A human-readable description for the type, intended
      for end users.  This property is OPTIONAL.
   *  rendering: An object containing rendering information for the
      type, as described in Section 8.1.  This property is OPTIONAL.

8.1.  Rendering Metadata

   The rendering property is an object containing rendering information
   for the type.  The object MUST contain a property for each rendering
   method that is supported by the type.  The property name MUST be a
   rendering method identifier and the property value MUST be an object
   containing the properties defined for the rendering method.

8.1.1.  Rendering Method "simple"

   The simple rendering method is intended for use in applications that
   do not support SVG rendering.  The object contains the following
   properties:

   *  logo: An object containing information about the logo to be
      displayed for the type, as described in Section 8.1.1.1.  This
      property is OPTIONAL.
   *  background_color: An RGB color value as defined in [W3C.CSS-COLOR]
      for the background of the credential.  This property is OPTIONAL.
   *  text_color: An RGB color value as defined in [W3C.CSS-COLOR] value
      for the text of the credential.  This property is OPTIONAL.

8.1.1.1.  Logo Metadata

   The logo property is an object containing information about the logo
   to be displayed for the type.  The object contains the following
   properties:

   *  uri: A URI pointing to the logo image.  This property is REQUIRED.
   *  uri#integrity: An "integrity metadata" string as described in
      Section 7.  This property is OPTIONAL.
   *  alt_text: A string containing alternative text for the logo image.
      This property is OPTIONAL.

8.1.2.  Rendering Method "svg_template"

   The svg_template rendering method is intended for use in applications
   that support SVG rendering.  The object MUST contain an array of
   objects containing information about the SVG templates available for
   the type.  Each object contains the following properties:

   *  uri: A URI pointing to the SVG template.  This property is
      REQUIRED.
   *  uri#integrity: An "integrity metadata" string as described in
      Section 7.  This property is OPTIONAL.
   *  properties: An object containing properties for the SVG template,
      as described in Section 8.1.2.1.  This property is REQUIRED if
      more than one SVG template is present, otherwise it is OPTIONAL.

8.1.2.1.  SVG Template Properties

   The properties property is an object containing properties for the
   SVG template.  Consuming applications MUST use these properties to
   find the best SVG template available for display to the user based on
   the display properties (landscape/portrait) and user preferences
   (color scheme, contrast).  The object MUST contain at least one of
   the following properties:

   *  orientation: The orientation for which the SVG template is
      optimized, with valid values being portrait and landscape.  This
      property is OPTIONAL.
   *  color_scheme: The color scheme for which the SVG template is
      optimized, with valid values being light and dark.  This property
      is OPTIONAL.
   *  contrast: The contrast for which the SVG template is optimized,
      with valid values being normal and high.  This property is
      OPTIONAL.

8.1.2.2.  SVG Rendering

   Consuming application MUST preprocess the SVG template by replacing
   placeholders in the SVG template with properly escaped values of the
   claims in the credential.  The placeholders MUST be defined in the
   SVG template using the syntax {{svg_id}}, where svg_id is an
   identifier defined in the claim metadata as described in Section 9.

   Placeholders MUST only be used in the text content of the SVG
   template and MUST NOT be used in any other part of the SVG template,
   e.g., in attributes or comments.

   A consuming application MUST ensure that all special characters in
   the claim values are properly escaped before inserting them into the
   SVG template.  At least the following characters MUST be escaped:

   *  & as &amp;
   *  < as &lt;
   *  > as &gt;
   *  " as &quot;
   *  ' as &apos;

   If the svg_id is not present in the claim metadata, the consuming
   application SHOULD reject not render the SVG template.  If the svg_id
   is present in the claim metadata, but the claim is not present in the
   credential, the placeholder MUST be replaced with an empty string or
   a string appropriate to indicate that the value is absent.

   The following non-normative example shows a minimal SVG with one
   placeholder using the svg_id value address_street_address which is
   defined in the example in Appendix B.2:

   <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100" height="100">
     <text x="10" y="20">Street address: {{address_street_address}}</text>
   </svg>

   When rendering the SVG template, the consuming application MUST
   ensure that malicious schema providers or issuers cannot inject
   executable code into the SVG template and thereby compromise the
   security of the consuming application.  The consuming application
   MUST NOT execute any code in the SVG template.  If code execution
   cannot be prevented reliably, the SVG display MUST be sandboxed.

9.  Claim Metadata

   The claims property is an array of objects containing information
   about particular claims for displaying and validating the claims.

   The array MAY contain an object for each claim that is supported by
   the type.  Each object contains the following properties:

   *  path: An array indicating the claim or claims that are being
      addressed, as described below.  This property is REQUIRED.
   *  display: An object containing display information for the claim,
      as described in Section 9.2.  This property is OPTIONAL.
   *  sd: A string indicating whether the claim is selectively
      disclosable, as described in Section 9.3.  This property is
      OPTIONAL.
   *  svg_id: A string defining the ID of the claim for reference in the
      SVG template, as described in Section 8.1.2.2.  The ID MUST be
      unique within the type metadata.  It MUST consist of only
      alphanumeric characters and underscores and MUST NOT start with a
      digit.  This property is OPTIONAL.

9.1.  Claim Path

   The path property MUST be a non-empty array of strings, null values,
   or non-negative integers.  It is used to select a particular claim in
   the credential or a set of claims.  A string indicates that the
   respective key is to be selected, a null value indicates that all
   elements of the currently selected array(s) are to be selected, and a
   non-negative integer indicates that the respective index in an array
   is to be selected.

   The following shows a non-normative, reduced example of a credential:

   {
     "vct": "https://betelgeuse.example.com/education_credential",
     "name": "Arthur Dent",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "42 Market Street",
       "city": "Milliways",
       "postal_code": "12345"
     },
     "degrees": [
       {
         "type": "Bachelor of Science",
         "university": "University of Betelgeuse"
       },
       {
         "type": "Master of Science",
         "university": "University of Betelgeuse"
       }
     ],
     "nationalities": ["British", "Betelgeusian"]
   }

   The following shows examples of path values and the respective
   selected claims in the credential above:

   *  ["name"]: The claim name with the value Arthur Dent is selected.
   *  ["address"]: The claim address with its sub-claims as the value is
      selected.
   *  ["address", "street_address"]: The claim street_address with the
      value 42 Market Street is selected.
   *  ["degrees", null, "type"]: All type claims in the degrees array
      are selected.

   In detail, the array is processed from left to right as follows:

   1.  Select the root element of the credential, i.e., the top-level
       JSON object.
   2.  Process the path components from left to right:
       1.  If the path component is a string, select the element in the
           respective key in the currently selected element(s).  If any
           of the currently selected element(s) is not an object, abort
           processing and return an error.  If the key does not exist in
           any element currently selected, remove that element from the
           selection.
       2.  If the path component is null, select all elements of the
           currently selected array(s).  If any of the currently
           selected element(s) is not an array, abort processing and
           return an error.
       3.  If the path component is a non-negative integer, select the
           element at the respective index in the currently selected
           array(s).  If any of the currently selected element(s) is not
           an array, abort processing and return an error.  If the index
           does not exist in a selected array, remove that array from
           the selection.
       4.  If the set of elements currently selected is empty, abort
           processing and return an error.

   The result of the processing is the set of elements to which the
   respective claim metadata applies.

   The path property MUST point to the respective claim as if all
   selectively disclosable claims were disclosed to a Verifier.  That
   means that a consuming application which does not have access to all
   disclosures may not be able to identify the claim which is being
   addressed.

   Note: This specification intentionally does not use JSON Pointer
   [RFC6901] for selecting claims, as JSON Pointer requires string
   parsing and does not support wildcard selection of array elements.
   It does not use JSON Path [RFC9535] as that introduces a considerable
   complexity and brings in many features which are not needed for the
   use case of selecting claims in a credential.  There are also
   security concerns with some implementations.

9.2.  Claim Display Metadata

   The display property is an array containing display information for
   the claim.  The array MUST contain an object for each language that
   is supported by the type.  The consuming application MUST use the
   language tag it considers most appropriate for the user.

   The objects in the array have the following properties:

   *  lang: A language tag as defined in Section 2 of [RFC5646].  This
      property is REQUIRED.
   *  label: A human-readable label for the claim, intended for end
      users.  This property is REQUIRED.
   *  description: A human-readable description for the claim, intended
      for end users.  This property is OPTIONAL.

9.3.  Claim Selective Disclosure Metadata

   The sd property is a string indicating whether the claim is
   selectively disclosable.  The following values are defined:

   *  always: The Issuer MUST make the claim selectively disclosable.
   *  allowed: The Issuer MAY make the claim selectively disclosable.
   *  never: The Issuer MUST NOT make the claim selectively disclosable.

   If omitted, the default value is allowed.

10.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations in the SD-JWT specification
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] apply to this
   specification.  Additionally, the following security considerations
   need to be taken into account when using SD-JWT VCs:

10.1.  Server-Side Request Forgery

   The JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration is retrieved from the JWT VC
   Issuer by the Holder or Verifier.  Similar to other metadata
   endpoints, the URL for the retrieval MUST be considered an untrusted
   value and could be a vector for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
   attacks.

   Before making a request to the JWT VC Issuer Metadata endpoint, the
   Holder or Verifier MUST validate the URL to ensure that it is a valid
   HTTPS URL and that it does not point to internal resources.  This
   requires, in particular, ensuring that the host part of the URL does
   not address an internal service (by IP address or an internal host
   name) and that, if an external DNS name is used, the resolved DNS
   name does not point to an internal IPv4 or IPv6 address.

   When retrieving the metadata, the Holder or Verifier MUST ensure that
   the request is made in a time-bound and size-bound manner to prevent
   denial of service attacks.  The Holder or Verifier MUST also ensure
   that the response is a valid JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration
   document before processing it.

   Additional considerations can be found in [OWASP_SSRF].

10.2.  Ecosystem-specific Public Key Verification Methods

   When defining ecosystem-specific rules for resolution and
   verification of the public key, as outlined in Section 3.5, it is
   critical that those rules maintain the integrity of the relationship
   between the iss value of the SD-JWT, if present, and the public keys
   of the Issuer.

   It MUST be ensured that for any given iss value, an attacker cannot
   influence the type of verification process used.  Otherwise, an
   attacker could attempt to make the Verifier use a verification
   process not intended by the Issuer, allowing the attacker to
   potentially manipulate the verification result to their advantage.

10.3.  Circular "extends" Dependencies of Types

   A type MUST NOT extend another type that extends (either directly or
   with steps in-between) the first type.  This would result in a
   circular dependency that could lead to infinite recursion when
   retrieving and processing the metadata.

   Consumers MUST detect such circular dependencies and reject the
   credential.

10.4.  Robust Retrieval of Type Metadata

   In Section 6.3, various methods for distributing and retrieving
   metadata are described.  Methods relying on a network connection may
   fail due to network issues or unavailability of a network connection
   due to offline usage of credentials, temporary server outages, or
   denial-of-service attacks on the metadata server.

   Consumers SHOULD therefore implement a local cache as described in
   Section 6.3.4 if possible.  Such a cache MAY be populated with
   metadata before the credential is used.

   Issuers MAY provide glue documents as described in Section 6.3.5 to
   provide metadata directly with the credential and avoid the need for
   network requests.

   These measures allow the Consumers to continue to function even if
   the metadata server is temporarily unavailable and avoid privacy
   issues as described in Section 12.1.

10.5.  Risks Associated with Textual Information

   Some claims in the SD-JWT VC and properties in the Type Metadata,
   e.g., display, allows issuers and providers of metadata to specify
   human-readable information.  These can contain arbitrary textual
   information that may be displayed to developers.  As such, any
   consuming application MUST ensure that maliciously crafted
   information cannot be used to compromise the security of the
   application or the privacy of the user.  To this end, the following
   considerations apply:

   *  The consuming application MUST ensure that the text is properly
      escaped before displaying it to the user or transferring it into
      other contexts.  For example, if the data is displayed in an HTML
      document, the text MUST be properly escaped to prevent Cross-Site
      Scripting (XSS) attacks.
   *  The consuming application MUST ensure that the display of the user
      interface elements cannot be distorted by overly long text or
      special characters.

11.  Privacy Considerations

   The Privacy Considerations in the SD-JWT specification
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] apply to this
   specification.  Additionally, the following privacy considerations
   need to be taken into account when using SD-JWT VCs.

11.1.  Unlinkability

   The Privacy Considerations in Section 10.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] apply especially to the cnf
   claim.

11.2.  Verifiable Credential Type Identifier

   Issuers and Holders have to be aware that while this specification
   supports selective disclosure of claims of a given SD-JWT VC, the vct
   claim is not selectively disclosable.  In certain situations this
   could lead to unwanted leakage of additional context information.

   In general, Issuers are advised to choose vct values following data
   minimization principles.  For example, government Issuers issuing an
   SD-JWT VC to their citizens to enable them to prove their age, might
   consider using a vct value that does not allow third-parties to infer
   additional personal information about the Holder, e.g., country of
   residency or citizenship.

   Additionally, Holders have to be informed that, besides the actual
   requested claims, the vct information is shared with the Verifier.

11.3.  Issuer Phone-Home

   A malicious Issuer can choose the Issuer identifier of the SD-JWT VC
   to enable tracking the usage behavior of the Holder if the Issuer
   identifier is Holder-specific and if the resolution of the key
   material to verify the Issuer-signed JWT requires the Verifier to
   phone home to the Issuer.

   For example, a malicious Issuer could generate a unique value for the
   Issuer identifier per Holder, e.g., https://example.com/issuer/
   holder-1234 and host the JWT VC Issuer Metadata.  The Verifier would
   create a HTTPS GET request to the Holder-specific well-known URI when
   the SD-JWT VC is verified.  This would allow the malicious Issuer to
   keep track where and how often the SD-JWT VC was used.

   Verifiers are advised to establish trust in an SD-JWT VC by pinning
   specific Issuer identifiers and should monitor suspicious behaviour
   such as frequently rotating Issuer identifiers.  If such behaviour
   was detected, Verifiers are advised to reject SD-JWT VCs issued by
   such Issuers.

   Holders are advised to reject SD-JWT VCs if they contain easily
   correlatable information in the Issuer identifier.

12.  Relationships to Other Documents

   This specification defines validation and processing rules for
   verifiable credentials using JSON payloads and secured by SD-JWT
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].  Other specifications
   exist that define their own verifiable credential formats; for
   example, W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model (VCDM) 2.0 [W3C.VCDM]
   defines a data model for verifiable credentials encoded as JSON-LD,
   and ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 [ISO.18013-5] defines a representation of
   verifiable credentials in the mobile document (mdoc) format encoded
   as CBOR and secured using COSE.

12.1.  Privacy-Preserving Retrieval of Type Metadata

   In Section 6.3, various methods for distributing and retrieving Type
   Metadata are described.  For methods which rely on a network
   connection to a URL (e.g., provided by an Issuer), third parties
   (like the Issuer) may be able to track the usage of a credential by
   observing requests to the Type Metadata URL.

   Consumers SHOULD prefer methods for retrieving Type Metadata that do
   not leak information about the usage of a credential to third
   parties.  The recommendations in Section 10.4 apply.

Appendix B.  Examples

   Important: The following examples are not normative and provided for
   illustrative purposes only.  In particular, neither the structure of
   the claims nor the selection of selectively disclosable claims are
   normative.

   Line breaks have been added for readability.

B.1.  Example 1: Person Identification Data (PID) Credential

   This example shows how the artifacts defined in this specification
   could be used to represent the concept of a Person Identification
   Data (PID) as defined in the "PID Rulebook" in [EUDIW.ARF].  This
   example uses fictional data of a German citizen.

   Key Binding is applied using the Holder's public key passed in a cnf
   claim in the SD-JWT.

   The following data about the citizen comprises the input JWT Claims
   Set used by the Issuer:

   {
     "iss": "https://pid-issuer.bund.de.example",
     "vct": "urn:eudi:pid:de:1",
     "given_name": "Erika",
     "family_name": "Mustermann",
     "birthdate": "1963-08-12",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "Heidestraße 17",
       "locality": "Köln",
       "postal_code": "51147",
       "country": "DE"
     },
     "nationalities": [
       "DE"
     ],
     "sex": 2,
     "birth_family_name": "Gabler",
     "place_of_birth": {
       "locality": "Berlin",
       "country": "DE"
     },
     "age_equal_or_over": {
       "12": true,
       "14": true,
       "16": true,
       "18": true,
       "21": true,
       "65": false

Appendix D.  Document History

   -10

   *  Rename 'Issuer-signed JWT Verification Key Validation' to 'Issuer
      Signature Mechanisms' and rework some text accordingly.  Provide a
      web-based metadata resolution mechanism and an inline x509
      mechanism.  A DID-based mechanism is not explicitly provided
      herein but still possible via profile/extension.  Be explicit that
      the employed Issuer Signature Mechanism has to be one that is
      permitted for the Issuer according to policy.  Be more clear that
      one permitted Issuer Signature Mechanism is sufficient.

   -09

   *  Use SD-JWT KB in place of SD-JWT with Key Binding JWT
   *  Editorial changes
   *  Document reasons for not using JSON Pointer or JSON Path (Issue
      #267)
   *  Clarify that private claim names MAY be used

      latest -14 version

   -06

   *  Update the anticipated media type registration request from
      application/vc+sd-jwt to application/dc+sd-jwt
   *  Tightened the exposition of the Issuer-signed JWT Verification Key
      Validation section
   *  Add the “Status” field for the well-known URI registration per
      IANA early review

   -05

   *  Include display and claim type metadata

      secure VCs and presentations
   *  Rework key resolution/validation for x5c

   -03

   *  Include disclosure of age_equal_or_over/18 in the PID example

   -02

   *  Made specific rules for public verification key validation
      conditional
   *  Finetuned rules for obtaining public verification key
   *  Editorial changes
   *  added Brian Campbell as co-author
   *  Renamed JWT Issuer Metadata to JWT VC Issuer Metadata
   *  'iat' is now optional and allowed to be selectively disclosable
   *  Fix inconstancy in the .well-known path construction
   *  Added registration request to IANA for the well-known URI
   *  Fix some formatting and text in the media type and JWT claim
      registration requests
